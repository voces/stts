The contents of this directory and all subdirectories were transliterated from JASS, pulled directly from war3map.j
(meaning vJASS and ZinC was compiled to JASS). The converted TypeScript was lightly massaged and split into triggers via
a script.

Large changes of the contents should be avoided. Instead, the relevant parts should first be pulled out of `/src/jass`
and refactored to semantic TypeScript.
